fb-unfollow
===========

A script to automate the otherwise tedious process of unfollowing all of your Facebook friends.

Simply execute it from the command line:

    unfollow_facebook_users.py <your.facebook.username> <your.facebook.password>

If you're using Mac OS X, you can also double-click the `Unfollow Facebook Users.command` file, which automates the process of installing the requirements into your home folder, listed below.

This is a [Selenium](http://SeleniumHQ.org/) script, written in Python, so you probably need to do:

    pip install --user selenium

if you haven't already. (And you need Python and [`pip`](http://pip-installer.org/) installed, of course.)
