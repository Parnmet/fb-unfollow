fb-unfollow
===========

A script to automate the otherwise tedious process of unfollowing all of your Facebook friends.

Simply execute it from the command line:

    unfollow_facebook_users.py <your.facebook.username> <your.facebook.password>

This is a [Selenium](//SeleniumHQ.org/) script, written in Python, so you probably need to do:

    pip install selenium

if you haven't already. (And you need Python and [`pip`](//pip-installer.org/) installed, of course.)
